## Description

The Gemini Project showcases the capabilities of the Gemini Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash models in two distinct applications. The text-to-text project demonstrates the model's ability to process and generate coherent and relevant text based on provided prompts. The image-to-text project highlights the model's proficiency in analyzing images and providing informative responses to related prompts. This repository serves as a comprehensive example of integrating advanced machine learning models into practical applications.

## Introduction

This repository includes two projects:

1. **Text-to-Text Project:** Uses the Gemini Pro model to convert input text into output text based on specific prompts.
2. **Image-to-Text Project:** Utilizes the Gemini 1.5 Flash model to analyze uploaded images and respond to prompts related to the images.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.8 or higher installed on your machine.
- An API key for accessing the Gemini models.

## Setup

### API Key

To access the Gemini models, you need to create an API key:

1. Visit the [Gemini API website](https://geminiapi.com).
2. Sign up or log in to your account.
3. Navigate to the API section and create a new API key.
4. Copy the API key and keep it secure.

### Dependencies

Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Projects

### Text-to-Text Project

This project uses the Gemini Pro model to process text input and generate text output.

**Location:** `app.py`

**Setup:**

1. Open the `app.py` file.
2. Replace the placeholder `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key.
3. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

**Usage:**

1. Provide the input text when prompted.
2. The script will process the text and generate an output based on the model's response.

### Image-to-Text Project

This project uses the Gemini 1.5 Flash model to analyze images and respond to prompts about the images.

**Location:** `vision.py`

**Setup:**

1. Open the `vision.py` file.
2. Replace the placeholder `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key.
3. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python vision.py
```

**Usage:**

1. Upload an image when prompted.
2. Provide a prompt related to the image.
3. The script will analyze the image and generate a response based on the model's output.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`).
